    <h1 align="center" >Iceland</h1>
    <p>Iceland is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist.
      Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular aexistence has spurred a rich
      and vibrant culture.</p>

        <p> The Aurora Borealis takes it's name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, 
          and the Greek name for the north wind. Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow
           <br> The Aurora Borealis, more commonly refered to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emmited 
           by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the earth's magnetic field.
          This releases energy, causing peculiar luminious green streaks accross the skies.</p>

        <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay attention to the countrie's namesake&#8212namely, 
          its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glacier is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull 
          and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell). </p>
