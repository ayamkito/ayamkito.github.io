    </p>
    <p>Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsyokull and is surrounded by some Iceland's most grand volcanos and during summertime, 
      a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location. 
      The popular day tour is the way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
